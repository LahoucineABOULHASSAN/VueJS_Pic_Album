      <h2>About PicAlbum</h2>
      <p>
        PicAlbum is a frontend website created with the framework Vue 3.<br />
        The Idea of it, is to use it to show my photography pictures, as well as
        it is a good practice for my frontend projects.<br />
        In this site i get to use many technologies such as Axios, Highligh.js,
        and moments.
